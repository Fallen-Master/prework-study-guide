# Prework Study Guide

## Description

- What was your motivation? My motivation for completing this prework study guide was to expand my knowledge of coding so that I can apply it to a future career.
- Why did you build this project?The problem was that I had no knowledge of what developers do or how they do it. I was also having trouble with the shading underneath the text boxes. The shadow was not showing, and there was only a gray outline. It seemed like I followed the instructions perfectly, but it turned out I was just missing an 8. To resolve this, I accessed the HTML Colors Code, found the correct color, and added the 8.
- What did you learn? I learned a lot, but a significant portion of it went over my head, and I probably can't remember all of it. Learning about Git was interesting. I'm not certain if I'm a true fan of it yet, but I can see its potential. I acquired the skill to create a basic HTML document without any elaborate features. Moreover, I learned how to style the page using CSS, which added some life and a touch of pizzazz to it. We also worked with JavaScript, although I'm not entirely sure about the specific tasks we undertook.
